## System Architecture

_High level overview of system architecture_

 
There are no links between pages, as the porpuse of this folder was simply to transpose the designs from [zeplin](zeplin.io/features) to Bootstrap.

So you are going to need to visit each page individually:


- [`http://localhost:8000/index.html`](http://localhost:8000/index.html)
- [`http://localhost:8000/story_start.html`](http://localhost:8000/story_start.html)
- [`http://localhost:8000/story_main.html`](http://localhost:8000/story_main.html)
- [`http://localhost:8000/ending.html`](http://localhost:8000/ending.html)
